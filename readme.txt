bug

Although I have to admit that money spent on research is generally well invested, for the kind of research whose results are "unclear", the funding on them might be unjustifiable. My points of view of the issue involve fundamental objectives, nature, and potential consequences, as discussed below.
On the philosophical side of this issue, governmental funding for research is almost always a good investment. After all, research is the exploration of the unknown for the true answer to our questions, and for the lasting solutions to our during problems. Research is also the chief means by which humans attempt to satisfy our insatiable appetite for knowledge, and our craving understand to ourselves and the world around us. Therefore, if research is to be of any values it must explore the uncharted and unpredicable territory. If we only invest in the research whose benefits are immediate and predicable, I query whether such research can break any new ground, or whether is can be considered as "research" at all.
